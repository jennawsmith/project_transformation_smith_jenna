### Resources

I used to boilerplate code that was used in the lecture for visually hidden. I got it from [David Walsh Blog](https://davidwalsh.name/html5-boilerplate). Other than that, I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.


###Deductions

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

###Comments

I really enjoyed this assignment because I think it will be extremely useful as we enter the "real world" of design and coding!

I'm not sure if I correctly linked to the outline or W3C Validator. I couldn't figure that out.
